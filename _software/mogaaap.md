During my PhD (2020-2025) I have developed the workflow MoGAAAP (<u>Mo</u>dular
<u>G</u>enome <u>A</u>ssembly, <u>A</u>nnotation and Quality <u>A</u>ssessment
<u>P</u>ipeline), written in Snakemake. This pipeline is designed to automate
the assembly, annotation and QA of sets of genomes with the aim of constructing
population-level pangenomes. It is modular, so that it can also be used for e.g.
the annotation and QA of an already existing assembly.
