For my PhD (2020-2025) I have developed several major features for PanTools as
well as general code improvements. I was involved in designing new features for
versions 3 and 4, and I have been one of the maintainers of version 4. Some of
the major features I have worked on include: (1) Implementation of integrating
PAV and VCF data into a pangenome graph for gene analysis. (2) Implementation
of a region of interest analysis in pangenomic context. (3) Update of PanTools
to Java 21 and neo4j 5.
